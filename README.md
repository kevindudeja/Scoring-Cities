### Update:
1. Short of time in the hackathon, we scraped the websites of data of just districts of one city.
2. Presented our idea as a webapp with a nice UI
3. If we had more regular data, we can make algorithms to predict which district would be the best to live in, in the next 5 years
4. Yes, this application is already present and running in US (www.areavibes.com)
5. But, because I randomly thought of this one day that it would be nice if I knew more about the city before buying a house, it was always in the back of my head, so I enjoyed taking this from a idea stage to a prototype stage. Good fun!

# Scoring-Cities
Helping citizens understand their sectors and cities better with a Scoring and Weightage model

### Abstract
Let say you want to compare two electronic products, phone A and phone B. So you google the reviews and the specifications of the products. Then based on those criteria's, you give weightage to them and score the products. 

The user(consumer) who reads your review gets an instant idea that if phone A is 8/10 and B is 6.5/10, A is a better product, and would prefer phone A.


Following a similar concept, we are creating an algorithm to score sectors and cities based on crime, health, education, transport and water sanitation. With this citizens and get a better idea about their cities and place where they live.


### Applications

1. If a user is planning to buy a new house in Gurgaon. He would prefer to buy it in a better locality, but how can he know if sector 46 is better to live in or sector 30?

2. Better Future City Planning: Knowing which sector needs planning or reworking. If for example Sector-46 has a lower score relative to Sector-30, then Sector-46 needs improvement in those areas to improve its score.
